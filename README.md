Problem: Are the Danish news biased in sentiment by those who bring them?

This executive summary serves as a brief overview of the main findings from the SentimentAnalysis of Danish Media. The in-depth analysis and data-processing can be seen [here].

PURPOSE:
The aim of the project was to conduct a sentiment analysis of news article headlines publishedby Danish news media Politiken and Børsen. 900k articles were collected from the two media’s websites, dating back to 1995. Using the sentiment dictionary AFINN1for Danish words thesentiment over time and towards specific topics were analysed and compared for the two media.This was done using API’s,web scraping,statistical methods such astime series analysis,wordclouds and LDA.

RESULTS:
According to the analysis,Børsenpresent more positive news thanPolitiken. Also, on chosenthemes - corona, finance and politics - the sentiment of the two media was significantly different.Particularly,Børsenwas positive on finance, contrary toP olitiken. Analysing the headlines over time, the length of the headlines have doubled over the past 20years. Further, the sentiment over time proved to slightly co-vary with the OMXC20 index. This relation was stronger forBørsenthan forPolitiken. Additionally,Politiken’s sentimentwas more positive in times of a left-winged government2- a correlation ofr= 0.38. This wassurprisingly also slightly the case forBørsen- withr= 0.18.Latent topics for both medias were discovered, to investigate which subjects the medias revolvedaround. It was found that articles printed in Børsen were more often associated with finance, whereas Politiken were more often associated with happenings in Denmark.
